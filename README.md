Hey, welcome to my profile! 👋

👋 My name is Harnit and I’m an aspiring data analyst based in London

👀 I recently started up my GitHub profile, so in the coming months there will be much more to see on here 

🤖 SQL is my first Language; Python is my second. I decided to learn SQL and Python because solving and finding solutions has always been an interest of mine

💫 I’ve just completed the Data Technician Bootcamp through @FirebrandTraining and two MOOC sprints with @CodeFirstGirls in Python and Machine Learning 

🌱 I recently started the SQL & Data course through @CodeFirstGirls where the final project will be on GitHub. Super Exciting! 

🥅 a few things on my bucket list are Skydiving, having afternoon tea in every country, and landing an internship/full time role in the data field (if you have this power, please hire me 🥹)

💞️ I’m looking for a role where I can practice and develop my craft further, and also bring positivity and light into a workspace
